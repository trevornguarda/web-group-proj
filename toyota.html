<p class="introcontent">Toyota Motor Corporation (Japanese: トヨタ自動車株式会社, Hepburn: Toyota Jidōsha kabushikigaisha, IPA: [toꜜjota], English: /tɔɪˈjoʊtə/, commonly known as simply Toyota) is a Japanese multinational automotive manufacturer headquartered in Toyota City, Aichi, Japan. It was founded by Kiichiro Toyoda and incorporated on August 28, 1937. Toyota is one of the largest automobile manufacturers in the world, producing about 10 million vehicles per year.</p>
<p>The company was originally founded as a spinoff of Toyota Industries, a machine maker started by Sakichi Toyoda, Kiichiro's father. Both companies are now part of the Toyota Group, one of the largest conglomerates in the world. While still a department of Toyota Industries, the company developed its first product, the Type A engine in 1934 and its first passenger car in 1936, the Toyota AA.</p>

<p>We'll discussing three different Toyota-made vehicles today: <br>

	</li>

</ul></p>
<h2><strong>Toyota Corolla</strong></h2>

<p class="introcontent">The Toyota Corolla (Japanese: トヨタ・カローラ, Hepburn: Toyota Karōra) is a series of compact cars (formerly subcompact) manufactured and marketed globally by Toyota. Introduced in 1966, the Corolla was the best-selling car worldwide by 1974 and has been one of the best-selling cars in the world since then. In 1997, the Corolla became the best selling nameplate in the world, surpassing the Volkswagen Beetle.Toyota reached the milestone of 50 million Corollas sold over twelve generations in 2021. The series has undergone several major redesigns.</p>
<p>The name Corolla is part of Toyota's naming tradition of using names derived from the Toyota Crown for sedans, with "corolla" Latin for "small crown". The Corolla has always been exclusive in Japan to Toyota Corolla Store locations, and manufactured in Japan with a twin, called the Toyota Sprinter until 2000. From 2006 to 2018 in Japan and much of the world, and from 2018 to 2020 in Taiwan, the hatchback companion had been called the Toyota Auris.
</p>	

<p> Early models were mostly rear-wheel drive, while later models have been front-wheel drive. Four-wheel drive versions have also been produced. The Corolla's traditional competitors have been the Nissan Sunny, introduced the same year as the Corolla in Japan and the later Nissan Sentra, Nissan Sylphy, Honda Civic and Mitsubishi Lancer. The Corolla's chassis designation code is "E", as described in Toyota's chassis and engine codes.</p>

<h2><strong>Toyota Avalon</strong></h2>

<p class="introcontent">The Toyota Avalon (Japanese: トヨタ・アバロン, Hepburn: Toyota Abaron) is a full-size sedan produced by Toyota. It is Toyota's largest front-wheel drive sedan and serves as its flagship vehicle in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, China and the Middle East. It was also produced in Australia from April 2000 until June 2005, when it was replaced in November 2006 by the Aurion. The first production Avalon rolled off the TMMK assembly line in Georgetown, Kentucky, in September 1994, and subsequent generations have all been manufactured at the Kentucky location to date.</p>
<p>Toyota marketed the Avalon as a replacement for the Cressida, a model discontinued for the American market in 1992. While the Cressida was an upper-level mid-size rear-wheel drive car with a straight-six engine, the Avalon is front-wheel drive, powered by a V6 engine. In recent years, there has been considerable overlapping with its platform mates, the Camry V6 and the Lexus ES, although the third-generation Avalon was distinguished by offering extra legroom. From 2013, the Avalon was built on a platform shared with the Lexus ES.
</p>	

<p> As of 2013, the Avalon is sold in the United States, Canada, China, Puerto Rico, South Korea and the Middle East.

	Avalon is a legendary island featured in the Arthurian legend, fitting it in with Toyota's tradition of naming their sedans the word for "crown" in various languages (Crown, Corona, Camry, Corolla), types of crowns (Tiara), or other things associated with royalty (Scepter).</p>

<h2><strong>Toyota Prius</strong></h2>

<p class="introcontent">
	The Toyota Prius (/ˈpriːəs/) (Japanese: トヨタ・プリウス, Hepburn: Toyota Puriusu) is a car built by Toyota which has a hybrid drivetrain, combining an internal combustion engine with an electric motor. Initially offered as a four-door sedan, it has been produced only as a five-door liftback since 2003.

In 2007, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and California Air Resources Board (CARB) rated the Prius as among the cleanest vehicles sold in the United States on the basis of smog-forming emissions. The 2018 model year Prius Eco ranked as the second-most-fuel-efficient gasoline-powered car without plug-in capability available in the US that year, following the Hyundai Ioniq Blue hybrid.]</p>

<p>The Prius first went on sale in Japan in 1997, and was available at all four Toyota Japan dealership chains, making it the first mass-produced hybrid vehicle. It was subsequently introduced worldwide in 2000. Toyota sells the Prius in over 90 markets, with Japan and the United States being its largest markets. Global cumulative Prius liftback sales reached the milestone 1 million vehicle mark in May 2008, 2 million in September 2010, and passed the 3 million mark in June 2013. Cumulative sales of one million were achieved in the U.S. by early April 2011, and Japan reached the 1 million mark in August 2011. As of January 2017, the Prius liftback was the world's top selling hybrid car with almost 4 million units sold.
</p>	

<p> In 2011, Toyota expanded the Prius family to include the Prius v, an extended hatchback, and the Prius c, a subcompact hatchback. The production version of the Prius plug-in hybrid was released in 2012. The second generation of the plug-in variant, the Prius Prime, was released in the U.S. in November 2016. The Prime achieved the highest miles per gallon equivalent (MPGe) rating in all-electric mode of any vehicle rated by EPA with an internal combustion engine. Global sales of the Prius c variant passed the one million mark during the first half of 2015. The Prius family totaled global cumulative sales of 6.1 million units in January 2017, representing 61% of the 10 million hybrids sold worldwide by Toyota since 1997.</p>

<h2><strong>My Favorite Toyota Car</strong></h2>

<p class="introcontent">
Though I don't own any Toyota vehicles, owning a Toyota Prius has been a life-long dream of mine since I was just 2 years old.
</p>
<p>
	I consider this vehicle to be the <i>'Apex'</i> automobile, sporting an economical design and fuel usage that makes vehicle-owners crumble to their knees.
